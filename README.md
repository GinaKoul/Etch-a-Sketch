# Etch-a-Sketch

This project contains a drawing board on which the user can draw either with the selected color from the colopicker or using the rainbow effect. An erasor and a clear button are also available if needed. 

The slider under the board can be used in order to adjust the grid size of the board in a scale of 1 to 100.
